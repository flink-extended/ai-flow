# What's Flink AI Flow

## Introduction
Flink AI Flow is an open source framework that bridges big data and artificial intelligence. 
It manages the entire machine learning project lifecycle as a unified workflow, including feature engineering, 
model training, model evaluation, model service, model inference, monitoring, etc. 
Throughout the entire workflow, Flink is used as the general purpose computing engine.

In addition to the capability of orchestrating a group of batch jobs, 
by leveraging an event-based scheduler(enhanced version of Airflow), 
Flink AI Flow also supports workflows that contain streaming jobs. Such capability is quite useful for complicated
real-time machine learning systems as well as other real-time workflows in general.

## Features
You can use Flink AI Flow to do the following:

![Alt text](../images/functions.png)

1. Define the machine learning workflows including batch/stream jobs.

2. Manage metadata(generated by the machine learning workflow) of datasets, models, artifacts, metrics, jobs etc.

3. Schedule and run the machine learning workflows from end to end.

4. Publish and subscribe various events and take corresponding actions.


To support online machine learning scenarios, notification service and event-based schedulers are introduced.
Flink AI Flow's current components are:

1. SDK: It defines how to build a machine learning workflow and contains the api of the Flink AI Flow.

2. Notification Service: It provides event listening and notification functions.

3. Metadata Service: It stores and serves the metadata of the datasets, projects and workflows.

4. Event-Based Scheduler: It is a pluggable component that take scheduling actions based on the received events in the system.
