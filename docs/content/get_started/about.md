# What's AIFlow

## Introduction
AIFlow is an event-driven workflow management framework that allows users to write machine learning pipelines that contain both stream and batch jobs. 

## Features
1. **Event-driven**: AIFlow schedule workflow and jobs based on events. This is more efficient than status-driven scheduling and be able to schedule the workflows that contain stream jobs.
2. **Extensible**: By implementing different job plugins, users can easily define their own processors and submit to different platforms.
3. **Metadata management**: AIFlow manages metadata(generated by the machine learning workflow) of datasets, models, artifacts, metrics, jobs, etc.
