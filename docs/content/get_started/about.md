# What's AIFlow

## Introduction
AIFlow is a project for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including feature engineering, 
model training, model evaluation, model service, model inference, monitoring, etc.
AIFlow organizes the jobs in the machine learning pipeline as a workflow. An AIFlow project can contain multiple workflows.
An AIFlow workflow includes datasets, jobs, job's input and output, and control relationships between jobs.

The AIFlow workflow can contain both batch jobs and stream jobs.
AIFlow provides an event-based scheduler (an enhanced version of Apache Airflow) 
that allows it to quickly schedule jobs and support complex scheduling logic.
These capabilities are useful for complex Real-time machine learning systems and other real-time workflows.

## Features
1. Define the machine learning workflows, including batch/stream jobs.

2. Scheduling workflows based on events, including scheduling workflows, running jobs, stopping jobs, etc.

3. Scheduling jobs for different machine learning frameworks, such as Tensorflow, Sklearn, etc.

4. Manage metadata(generated by the machine learning workflow) of datasets, models, artifacts, metrics, jobs etc.

5. Publish and subscribe various events and take corresponding actions.
